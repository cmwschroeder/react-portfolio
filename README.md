# React Portfolio

## Description

This is a react portfolio designed for me, Christian Schroeder. This portfolio loads all content on a single page by changing which react components are shown when clicking the links in the navbar. There is an about me section, projects section, contact me section, and resume section. The about me section contains a short bio of me. The contact section has forms that you can fill out and will give feedback, although they won't actually contact me. The project section contains pictures of past projects I have made, with links to the deployed site and github. The resume section will open a new tab with my resume that is downloadable.
